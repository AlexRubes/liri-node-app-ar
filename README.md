# liri-node-app-ar

In this bootcamp assignment, I built a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. The following 3 commands pull data from APIs:  

* `my-tweets` - pulls my tweets from Twitter API 

* `spotify-this-song` - searches song info by song name from Spotify API

* `movie-this` - searches movie info by movie title from OMDB API

* `do-what-it-says` - pulls data from random.txt file and runs function for 'spotify-this-song'

Using npm init to add package.json and npm install to install npm packages for the above API's, this app works in node. Access tokens, IDs and keys are private and anyone who uses this app must get their own. User must type command and required input to retrieve relevant informtion. If the user fails to enter required inputs, the command will default to set song or movie.
